        <h4>The Mission</h4>
            <p>Your games obsessed manager has a nice little side project for you: vizualize some interesting aspects about his poorly scraped steam data. He's managed to compile a json file containing data on some 1000 odd games sold on the popular digital games storefront steam.

            
            He'd like you to show him a proof of concept to translate data, visualize said data and deploy a little server so he can see if it is worth investing more time in.
            </p>

        <h5>Must-have features</h5>
            <p> 1. At least one visualization on the data.<br>

                2. Deployment using Flask+docker+heroku.<br>

                3. Json parsing to SQL data (you can use any number of layers in between, e.g. json > python objects > SQL data)
                   any SQL database framework.<br>

                4. Data retrieval from SQL database.<br>
