### The Mission

Your games obsessed manager has a nice little side project for you: vizualize some interesting aspects about his poorly scraped steam data. He's managed to compile a json file containing data on some 1000 odd games sold on the popular digital games storefront steam.
          
He'd like you to show him a proof of concept to translate data, visualize said data and deploy a little server so he can see if it is worth investing more time in.

### Must-have features

* At least one visualization on the data.
* Deployment using Flask+docker+heroku.
* Json parsing to SQL data (you can use any number of layers in between, e.g. json > python objects > SQL data)
   any SQL database framework.
* Data retrieval from SQL database.

### Nice-to-haves

* A database having a relational structure, making use of primary keys, foreign keys,...
* Interactive visualizations on the deployed site (e.g. genre filtering)
  timeseries visualizations
* Gross/net revenu estimation using the date-adjusted boxleiter method


### Link to the Heroku app

Heroku link: https://steam-nichelle.herokuapp.com/

### Timeline

* Duration:`2 weeks`
* Deadline: `28/12/2021 16.30`
* Team challenge: `individual`

### Improvements to be made
* Need to add interactive graph to the heroku app.
* Need to do more data preprocessing to be able to access more features for data analysis.
* Need to deploy using docker and work on the nice to have features.
